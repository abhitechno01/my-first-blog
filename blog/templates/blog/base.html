			Start your virtual environment by running: C:\Users\Name\djangogirls> myvenv\Scripts\activate
			On Windows; don't forget to add the period (or dot) . at the end:
			(myvenv) C:\Users\Name\djangogirls> django-admin startproject mysite .
			django-admin.py is a script that will create the directories and files for you. You should now have a directory structure which looks like this:

			djangogirls
			├───manage.py
			└───mysite
        			settings.py
        			urls.py
        			wsgi.py
        			__init__.py
        	manage.py is a script that helps with management of the site. With it we will be able to start a web server on our computer without installing anything else, amongst other things.
        	The settings.py file contains the configuration of your website.
			Remember when we talked about a mail carrier checking where to deliver a letter? urls.py file contains a list of patterns used by urlresolver.

				Let's make some changes in mysite/settings.py. Open the file using the code editor you installed earlier.

				It would be nice to have the correct time on our website. Go to the wikipedia timezones list and copy your relevant time zone (TZ). (eg. Europe/Berlin )

				In settings.py, find the line that contains TIME_ZONE and modify it to choose your own timezone:
				TIME_ZONE = 'Europe/Berlin'
				Modifying "Europe/Berlin" as appropriate
				We'll also need to add a path for static files (we'll find out all about static files and CSS later in the tutorial). Go down to the end of the file, and just underneath the STATIC_URL entry, add a new one called STATIC_ROOT:
				STATIC_URL = '/static/'
				STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')
